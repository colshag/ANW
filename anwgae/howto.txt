Getting everything setup.

First time:

go into /anwlaunch/launcher
run ./testmode.sh
(this creates a /home/username/.anw directory for you)

goto /home/username/.anw/
create server.config

put the following in there:

[ArmadaNetWarsServer]
serveruser = user1
serverpass = pass1


start in anwgae

./startDevl.sh &
python client.py  # gets all users setup

switch to anw/Server

./localWizard.sh
./testserver.sh

switch to anwlaunch/launcher
./testmode.sh
login as user1/pass1
launch a game of ANW4  
You should now be logged into the game!
