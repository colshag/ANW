ANW Ideas
=========

This document is meant as a placeholder for new ideas to implement in the game as development continues.  As Ideas become permanent they will
be implemented into the DDD document.

============
- All Empires will be represented by 2 colors instead of just one, this opens up a large number of extra empires
- There is a much higher limit to the number of Empires in the game.  Although more then 8 human players would slow down the game, there is
no reason that ANW couldn't have many more empires filled in by AI players.
- There would be a set number of colors to choose an Empire from, colors range from say 1 to 16.  so there could be around 16x16 Empires (256).
- AI players will not auto-align with each other.  Each one acts independantly of each other and treats humans/AI the same
- There will be less Neutral Planets, every Neutral Planet is instead an AI Empire with potentially only 1 planet to start with.
- Planets might be better thought of as solar systems, or simply systems.  They can be represented by something other then a sphere, like a
diamond or something that can show the 2 color scheme of ownership easier.  A system represents all the planets and productivity of a solar system.
- All Ship/Marine 3D Models will be designed in grey-scale, with 3 main textures.  Textures that are colored by a choosable color, textures that
are colored by the second color, and textures that are not affected by the colors at all.  This must be tested with the OGRE system.  (Think
Homeworld).
- Since there is a much larger potential for Empires, the Player will only be able to contact Empires that have been scouted.  The Galactic Map
will also only reveal planets that have been scouted.  However, the overall Map layout will be revealed, just not the Empire Ownership.
